# Narrative
Write a function that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer that does not occur on A.

Writen an efficient algorithm with th efollowing assumptions:
* Each element of array is an integer within the range [- 10,000,000.. 10,000,000]
* N is an intenger within the range [1.. 100,000]

## Example input /Output

Given  A = [1,2,3], the function return 4.

Given  A = [-1,-3], the function return 1.
